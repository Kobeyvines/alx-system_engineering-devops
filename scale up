Scale Up Web Infrastructure Explanation

This infrastructure consists of three separate servers, each dedicated to a specific component of the web application: the web server, the application server, and the database server. Additionally, it includes a load balancer cluster with two HAProxy instances for high availability.
Components Added and Their Purpose:

    Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy):

        Why added? To distribute incoming client requests evenly across multiple backend servers and to provide high availability.

        The two HAProxy servers are configured in an Active-Active cluster to ensure continuous service even if one load balancer fails. This improves fault tolerance and reduces downtime.

    Web Server (Nginx) on Its Own Server:

        Why separated? The web server handles HTTP requests, static content, and acts as a reverse proxy. Isolating it improves performance and security by limiting the responsibilities on a single server.

        Dedicated resources help it efficiently serve content without competing with application logic or database operations.

    Application Server on Its Own Server:

        Why separated? The application server processes the business logic and interacts with the database. Separating it from the web server allows for better scalability and easier maintenance.

        This separation also allows application-specific optimizations without affecting the web server.

    Database Server (MySQL) on Its Own Server:

        Why separated? The database is a resource-intensive component needing dedicated resources to handle data storage and queries efficiently.

        Isolating the database enhances data security and allows it to be scaled independently as the application grows.

How This Infrastructure Works:

    When a user visits www.foobar.com, DNS directs the request to one of the load balancers.

    The load balancers distribute requests across the web servers to balance traffic and ensure no single server becomes overloaded.

    The web server forwards dynamic requests to the application server, which executes the business logic.

    The application server communicates with the database server to read or write data as needed.

    Responses flow back through the application server and web server to the user.

Benefits:

    Fault tolerance: The HAProxy load balancer cluster avoids a single point of failure at the load balancer layer.

    Scalability: Each tier can be scaled independently based on load. For example, more web servers or app servers can be added without affecting the database server.

    Improved performance: Dedicated servers ensure resources arenâ€™t competed for across different components.

    Easier maintenance: Updates and patches can be applied to individual components without impacting others.
